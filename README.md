# Ziad Hamama ‚Äî Portfolio Website

This is my personal developer portfolio, designed and coded to showcase my technical skills and project experience.

Built using:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for a fully responsive and interactive front-end.
- **Custom JavaScript** for animations, carousel components, and smooth navigation.
- **EmailJS** integrated for the contact form to securely handle form submissions without needing a separate backend server.

The site is hosted on **GitHub Pages** for easy deployment and version control.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights
- **Front-End:** Modern, mobile-first design using semantic HTML and custom CSS. No frameworks ‚Äî built from scratch for full control over layout and styling.
- **Interactivity:** Custom JavaScript handles user interactions, project carousels, and click events for external project links.
- **Backend Functionality:** Contact form uses **EmailJS** to send user messages directly to my email, providing dynamic form handling without a traditional server-side backend.
- **Version Control:** Managed through Git and GitHub with a clean commit history and continuous deployment through GitHub Pages.
